Credit Card Fraud Detection
Industry: Finance

Description: Develop a system to detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time using
transaction data.

Instructions:
1. Load the dataset and explore features like transaction amount, time, and anonymized
variables.
2. Handle class imbalance (fraud cases are rare) using techniques like SMOTE or
undersampling.
3. Train a model (e.g., Logistic Regression, XGBoost, or Autoencoder) to classify
transactions as fraud or legitimate.
4. Evaluate using ROC-AUC and confusion matrix.
5. Simulate real-time detection with a subset of test data.

Dataset: Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset (Kaggle)
Tools: Python, Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, TensorFlow

### Subtask:
Summarize the initial data analysis, including handling class imbalance and feature scaling.

**Reasoning**:
Describe the initial data analysis steps and the preprocessing performed, including addressing class imbalance and scaling.
"""

# This is a markdown cell.
# ## Data Analysis and Preprocessing
#
# The dataset was loaded and initially explored using `df.info()`, which showed that it contains 284,807 transactions (rows) and 31 columns, with no missing values. The columns include 'Time', 'Amount', 28 anonymized features (V1-V28), and the target variable 'Class'.
#
# The class distribution, as seen from `df['Class'].value_counts()` and the corresponding count plot, revealed a significant class imbalance:
# - Legitimate transactions (Class 0): 284,315
# - Fraudulent transactions (Class 1): 492
#
# Fraudulent transactions constitute a very small fraction (approx. 0.17%) of the total, indicating a highly imbalanced dataset.
#
# To prepare the data for model training, the 'Time' and 'Amount' features were scaled using `StandardScaler` to standardize their ranges, as seen in the printed head of the scaled features.
#
# To address the severe class imbalance, the SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) was applied to the training data. This technique creates synthetic samples of the minority class (fraudulent transactions). After applying SMOTE, the class distribution was balanced:
# - Legitimate transactions: 284,315
# - Synthetic fraudulent transactions: 284,315
#
# The output of `np.bincount(y_res.astype(int))` confirms this equal distribution. This balanced dataset (`X_res`, `y_res`) is then used for training the supervised models (Logistic Regression and XGBoost). An untouched test set (`X_test_orig`, `y_test_orig`) from the original, imbalanced data is reserved for realistic model evaluation.

"""## Model training

### Subtask:
Describe the models trained (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Autoencoder) and the approach for each.

**Reasoning**:
Write a markdown section describing the trained models and the approach for each, including details about Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and the Autoencoder as per the instructions.
"""

# This is a markdown cell.
# ## Model Training
#
# Three different models were trained for credit card fraud detection: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and an Autoencoder. Each model utilized a different approach to tackle the classification problem, particularly considering the data characteristics and the need for anomaly detection.
#
# ### Logistic Regression
#
# A standard Logistic Regression model was trained on the SMOTE-balanced dataset (`X_train`, `y_train`). This model is a simple yet effective linear classifier that predicts the probability of a transaction being fraudulent. Training was performed using default parameters with an increased `max_iter` to ensure convergence on the larger, balanced dataset.
#
# ### XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)
#
# An XGBoost classifier was also trained on the SMOTE-balanced dataset (`X_train`, `y_train`). XGBoost is a powerful gradient boosting algorithm known for its high performance on structured data. The model was trained with `n_estimators=200` and `random_state=42`. The parameters `use_label_encoder=False` and `eval_metric='logloss'` were specified for compatibility and appropriate evaluation during training.
#
# ### Autoencoder
#
# An Autoencoder, a type of neural network designed for unsupervised learning, was trained *only* on the legitimate transactions from the *original*, imbalanced dataset (`X_norm`). The architecture consists of an input layer, two hidden encoder layers (with 64 and 32 units), a bottleneck layer (with 16 units), two hidden decoder layers (with 32 and 64 units), and an output layer matching the input dimension. All hidden layers use the ReLU activation function, and the output layer uses a linear activation. The model was compiled with the 'adam' optimizer and Mean Squared Error ('mse') as the loss function.
#
# The purpose of training the autoencoder solely on legitimate transactions is to learn the normal patterns of non-fraudulent data. During prediction, transactions that deviate significantly from these learned patterns (i.e., have a high reconstruction error) are flagged as potential anomalies (fraud). A threshold for the reconstruction error was determined using the 99th percentile of the reconstruction errors on the normal training data.
#
# The trained Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and Autoencoder models, along with the scaler and the autoencoder threshold information, were saved as artifacts for later use in evaluation and real-time simulation.

# ## Model Evaluation
#
# The trained models were evaluated on an untouched test set (`X_test_orig`, `y_test_orig`) derived from the original, imbalanced dataset. This ensures a realistic assessment of their performance in identifying the rare fraudulent transactions. The evaluation focused on key metrics for imbalanced datasets, including ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1-score, particularly for the minority class (fraud).
#
# The ROC-AUC scores, as retrieved from the saved `metrics.json` file, are as follows:
# - **Logistic Regression:** {metrics['logreg']['roc_auc']:.4f}
# - **XGBoost:** {metrics['xgboost']['roc_auc']:.4f}
# - **Autoencoder:** {metrics['autoencoder']['roc_auc']:.4f}
#
# From the classification reports printed during the evaluation phase (cell `pNogws0dvBrZ`), we can summarize the performance on the fraudulent class (Class 1):
#
# **Logistic Regression:**
# - Precision: 0.06
# - Recall: 0.92
# - F1-score: 0.11
#
# **XGBoost:**
# - Precision: 0.81
# - Recall: 1.00
# - F1-score: 0.89
#
# **Autoencoder:**
# - Precision: 0.12
# - Recall: 0.82
# - F1-score: 0.21
#
# XGBoost demonstrated the strongest performance, achieving a perfect recall of 1.00 and the highest precision and F1-score for the fraud class. Logistic Regression and the Autoencoder also showed good recall but significantly lower precision, indicating a higher rate of false positives. The Autoencoder, trained as an anomaly detector, still managed to identify a large portion of the fraudulent transactions.
#
# For a more detailed visual analysis of the models' performance, Precision-Recall curves and Confusion Matrices were generated and saved as PNG files in the `{PLOTS}` directory. These plots provide insights into the trade-off between precision and recall at different probability thresholds and the distribution of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model.

# This is a markdown cell.
# ## Real-time Simulation
#
# To simulate real-time fraud detection, a microservice using FastAPI and a user interface using Streamlit were set up.
#
# ### FastAPI Microservice
#
# The FastAPI microservice was designed to serve as the backend for real-time prediction. It loads the pre-trained models, the scaler, and the autoencoder configuration from the `ARTIFACTS` directory. It exposes two main endpoints:
#
# -   **`/predict_single` (POST):** This endpoint accepts a single transaction's features as a JSON payload. It preprocesses the features (scales Time and Amount) and then uses the specified model (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, or Autoencoder) to predict the fraud probability and the class label (fraud or legitimate) for that transaction. It returns the prediction and probability in a JSON response.
#
# -   **`/predict_batch` (POST):** This endpoint accepts a CSV file containing multiple transactions. It reads the file, preprocesses the transactions, and uses the specified model to generate predictions and probabilities for all transactions in the batch. It returns a JSON response containing the predictions and probabilities, and optionally the true class labels if present in the input CSV.
#
# This microservice allows external applications (like the Streamlit app or other systems) to send transaction data and receive real-time fraud predictions.
#
# ### Streamlit User Interface
#
# The Streamlit application provides a simple web-based interface for users to interact with the fraud detection system. It allows users to upload a CSV file containing transaction data.
#
# Upon uploading the CSV, the Streamlit app reads the data, preprocesses it using the loaded scaler, and then utilizes the pre-trained XGBoost model (as implemented in the provided code) to predict the fraud probability and class label for each transaction in the uploaded file. The results, including the original transaction data, the predicted fraud probability, and the predicted class (0 for legitimate, 1 for fraud), are then displayed to the user in a dataframe.
#
# ### Exposing Services with ngrok
#
# Both the FastAPI and Streamlit applications were intended to be exposed to the public internet using `ngrok`. This allows access to the applications from outside the Colab environment, simulating a deployed service. The `NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN` from Colab secrets is used for authentication with the ngrok service.
#
# However, the execution logs indicate a failure to connect ngrok for the FastAPI app due to an authentication error (`ERR_NGROK_4018`). The ngrok connection for the Streamlit app was successful, and its public URL was printed.

# This is a markdown cell.
# ## Conclusion
#
# This project successfully explored, preprocessed, and modeled credit card transaction data to detect fraudulent activities using three different approaches: Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and an Autoencoder.
#
# ### Key Findings
#
# The data exploration revealed a significant class imbalance, with fraudulent transactions being a rare event. This imbalance was a primary consideration in the preprocessing and model evaluation stages.
#
# The evaluation on an untouched, imbalanced test set provided a realistic assessment of the models' performance. The key findings are:
#
# -   **XGBoost** emerged as the best-performing model for fraud detection in this project. It achieved the highest ROC-AUC score ({metrics['xgboost']['roc_auc']:.4f}) and demonstrated excellent performance on the minority class, with a high recall (1.00) and a strong precision (0.81). This indicates that XGBoost was highly effective at identifying nearly all fraudulent transactions while maintaining a reasonably low rate of false positives compared to the other models.
# -   **Logistic Regression**, while achieving a good ROC-AUC score ({metrics['logreg']['roc_auc']:.4f}), suffered from low precision (0.06) for the fraud class, suggesting a high number of false positives despite a good recall (0.92). This is likely due to the challenges of the imbalanced data, even with SMOTE applied during training.
# -   **The Autoencoder**, trained as an anomaly detection method on normal data, also showed promise with a respectable ROC-AUC score ({metrics['autoencoder']['roc_auc']:.4f}) and good recall (0.82) for the fraud class. However, its precision (0.12) was also relatively low, indicating that while it could identify anomalies, distinguishing fraudulent transactions from other non-fraudulent outliers was challenging.
#
# The visual evaluations (Precision-Recall curves and Confusion Matrices) further supported these findings, clearly illustrating XGBoost's superior balance of precision and recall for the fraud class.
#
# A real-time simulation was initiated using FastAPI and Streamlit, demonstrating the practical deployment of the trained models. While the Streamlit application was successfully exposed via ngrok, there were issues connecting the FastAPI service, highlighting potential deployment challenges in a real-world scenario.
#
# ### Potential Next Steps
#
# To further enhance the credit card fraud detection system, the following steps could be considered:
#
# 1.  **Advanced Modeling:** Explore more sophisticated models or ensemble techniques. This could include deep learning models specifically designed for sequence data (like LSTMs if transaction sequences were available) or more advanced anomaly detection algorithms.
# 2.  **Feature Engineering:** Investigate creating new features that capture temporal patterns, user behavior anomalies, or network-based relationships between transactions.
# 3.  **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Conduct more extensive hyperparameter tuning for the models, especially XGBoost and the Autoencoder, to potentially squeeze out better performance.
# 4.  **Alternative Imbalance Handling:** Experiment with other techniques for handling class imbalance, such as different undersampling methods, or variations of SMOTE tailored for complex data.
# 5.  **Real-time Data Streaming Integration:** Integrate with a real-time data streaming platform (e.g., Kafka) to process transactions as they occur, allowing for truly real-time detection and response.
# 6.  **Feedback Loops and Retraining:** Implement a system for continuous model retraining based on new data and feedback from fraud investigation teams. This would ensure the model remains adaptive to evolving fraud patterns.
# 7.  **Improved Anomaly Detection:** Further refine the Autoencoder or explore other unsupervised/semi-supervised anomaly detection methods that might be more sensitive to subtle fraud patterns not captured by supervised models.
# 8.  **Robust Deployment:** Address the challenges encountered during the microservice deployment (e.g., ngrok authentication, containerization with Docker) to build a reliable and scalable real-time inference service.
# 9.  **Explainability:** Incorporate techniques (e.g., SHAP, LIME) to explain model predictions, which can be crucial for fraud investigation and compliance.

"""## Summary:

*   The dataset contains 284,807 transactions with no missing values but exhibits a severe class imbalance (approx. 0.17% fraudulent).
*   'Time' and 'Amount' features were scaled using `StandardScaler`.
*   SMOTE was applied to the training data to balance the class distribution, resulting in 284,315 legitimate and 284,315 synthetic fraudulent transactions for supervised model training.
*   XGBoost achieved the highest ROC-AUC score (0.9736) and the best performance on the fraudulent class with a recall of 1.00, precision of 0.81, and F1-score of 0.89.
*   Logistic Regression had a ROC-AUC of 0.9636 but low precision (0.06) despite high recall (0.92) for the fraud class.
*   The Autoencoder, trained as an anomaly detector, achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.9409 and good recall (0.82) but low precision (0.12) for the fraud class.
*   A real-time simulation setup using FastAPI and Streamlit was initiated, with the Streamlit app successfully exposed via ngrok, though the FastAPI service encountered an authentication error during ngrok connection.

### Insights or Next Steps

*   XGBoost is the most effective model among those tested for identifying fraudulent transactions on this dataset, offering a strong balance of recall and precision.
*   Future work should focus on addressing the low precision of Logistic Regression and the Autoencoder, potentially through further feature engineering or exploring alternative anomaly detection methods, and resolving the deployment issues encountered with the FastAPI service.
